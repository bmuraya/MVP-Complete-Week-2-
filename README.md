# Progress Assessment

In Week 2, our "Homeony" household management application project has made remarkable progress. We conducted a thorough assessment of our achievements, identified areas for improvement, and ensured alignment with our goals

Meanwhile, one of the key areas of progress was in Customer Satisfaction and Feedback which we didnâ€™t include in our previous document
